# search-engine
A na√Øve search engine developed using the map reduce technology as part of an assignment for the course of fundamentals of big data analytics 
# introduction:
This repository contains the implementation of a basic search engine using Apache Hadoop's MapReduce paradigm. The search engine is designed to handle large datasets efficiently by distributing processing tasks across multiple nodes in a cluster environment.
# Features:
Document Indexing: Indexes a corpus of text documents using the TF/IDF vector space model.
Query Processing: Calculates relevance scores between queries and indexed documents.
MapReduce Implementation: Utilizes Hadoop's MapReduce framework for parallel processing.
Sparse Vector Representation: Implements sparse vector representation to handle high-dimensional data efficiently.
Basic Vector Space Model: Implements the TF/IDF vector space model for information retrieval.
Cloud Deployment: Recommends deployment on cloud computing platforms like Microsoft Azure Cloud for scalability.
# Assignment structure:
src/: Contains the source code for the MapReduce jobs.
mapper.py: code for mapping jobs
reducer.py: code for reducing jobs
README.md: Documentation providing an overview of the project.
